# Fall 2023 first year MS research assistant rotation projects

## Overview

The overall research theme of our lab can be found in the lab wiki at: https://wanggroup.org/. 
As of now (September 15, 2023) some project specific contents are a out-dated. 
I will outline some of the research topics relevant to your projects in the orientation tasks below. 

Before you decide if you would like to start working with us, please read the [lab "rules"](https://wanggroup.org/orientation/index.html#lab-rules), particularly a section for "Master students".
If you find these are acceptable to you, please reach out to me to start your rotation project.

In the next month, you will pick from one of the 3 projects and push them forward as much as you can.
The projects are designed for somewhat savvy students to complete within a month, so I don't expect everyone to complete all the tasks.
What's perhaps more important is to demonstrate your motivation, hardwork, communication and problem solving skills during the month of work.
In particular, **your ability to work well with the senior trainee(s) who will be supervising your work alongside with myself**. 
This aspect is of crucial importance in our lab. We need trainees to get along well and stimulate each other to be productive.

Below, I outline 3 projects for you to choose from. 
Please browse them, but I would suggest to not pick it yet before our interview --- I would like to hear and know you better, and recommend a project for you, based on my past experiences interacting with first year students working on projects from my lab.

## Project 1: Building software package for a new "colocalization analysis" method we have recently developed
